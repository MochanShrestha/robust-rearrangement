Steps for sim to real
- Convert `.obj` files into `.usd` files. You can use the `convert_parts_to_usd.py` script for this (may have to hack it a bit to point the paths in the right place)
- Update the `part_config_dict` dictionary in `part_config_render.py` with a new dictionary for any new tasks. See the existing ones for the information that should be included, and see `isaac_lab_rerender.py` for how this information is used (mainly to know where the `.usd` assets are and to have some name for the prims that are loaded into the scene)
- Ensure Isaac Sim and IsaacLab are set up (easiest way is to follow the `pip install` instructions on the Isaac Lab documentation - this will require a different `conda` environment with `python=3.10`)
- Run `isaac_lab_rerender.py` with all the relevant information specified (mainly, what task to re-render, what folder to load `.pkl` trajectories from, whether domain randomization should be used or not (there is still a bug in the script that does not parse these flags properly - manually set domain randomization on/off in the script if needed until it's resolved), and whether to save the new data + where to save it)

Then, follow the same procedure you did at the beginning with your demos -- process the pickle files into `zarr`s and train a model!
